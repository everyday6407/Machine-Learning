# Machine-Learning
Part 1:
Fit a SVM model to the data. Try out two kernels: the linear kernel (which essentially
means no kernel - our main case studied in class) and the Gaussian (or rbf) kernel. To illustrate your
results, draw the graphs of the constructed decision boundaries and the resulting support vectors.
Report the confusion matrix, precision, recall, F-tests, accuracy for each estimated classification.
Part 2:
Try out different value of the regularization parameter. What do you observe? To illustrate
your results, draw the graphs of the constructed decision boundaries and the resulting support vectors.
Report the confusion matrix, precision, recall, F-tests, accuracy for each estimated classification.
